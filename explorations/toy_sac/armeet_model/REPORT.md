# Armeet SAC Inverted Double Pendulum

All of my code, metric results, checkpoints, and information is on my repo: https://github.com/armeetj/sac-pendulum (to not clutter main repo with checkpoints and other bulky files)
In summary, my highest score was 9359.85 after 614 episodes (< 5 min of training). I also trained a model with the updated v5 double inverted pendulum (see my repo).

Here's a cool demo (I have more in the repo)! I added some code to enable keyboard inputs, to see how the actor recovers.
